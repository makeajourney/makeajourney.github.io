# Vagrant  

[VAGRANT](https://www.vagrantup.com/)  

the command line utility for managing the lifecycle of virtual machines.  
Vagrant provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments built on top of industry-standard technology.  


## generate Vagrantfile  

```sh
vagrant init
```  

If you need to configure project, you can edit Vagrantfile.  Vagrantfile is placed project directory that you executed `vagrant init`.  


---

## deploy vm

```sh
vagrant up
```  


---

## connect vm

```sh
vagrant ssh
```  

`logout` commandë¡œ connection close


---

## destroy vm  

```sh
vagrant destroy
```  


---

## remove box file

```sh
vagrant box remove
```  


---

## synced folders

By default, Vagrant shares your project directory (remember, that is the one with the Vagrantfile) to the /vagrant directory in your guest machine.  


---

## provision  

add `bootstrap.sh` file in the same directory as Vagrantfile  

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y apache2
if ! [ -L /var/www ]; then
  rm -rf /var/www
  ln -fs /vagrant /var/www
fi
```  

edit `Vagrantfile`  

```{.ruby}
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "hashicorp/precise64"
  config.vm.provision :shell, path: "bootstrap.sh"
end
```  

`vagrant up`  
or  
if guest machine is already running  

```sh
vagrant reload --provision
```  


---

## port forwarding  

```{.ruby}
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "hashicorp/precise64"
  config.vm.provision :shell, path: "bootstrap.sh"
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 4567
end
```  

Run a `vagrant reload` or `vagrant up`

```sh
vagrant suspend
```


### halting

shut down the guest operating system and power down the guest machine.  

```sh
vagrant halt
```


### destroying

```
you can use `vmware_fusion`, `aws` and more as provider name.
